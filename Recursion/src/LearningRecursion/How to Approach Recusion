While solving recursion problems:

    1. Identify if you can break the problems into sub problems.
    2. Write the recursion relation if needed.
    3. Draw the recurssive tree.
    4. About the tree
        a. See the flow of functions, how they are getting in the stack.
        b. Identify the flow of left tree and right tree.
        c. Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen and paper.
        d. use a pen and paper to see the flow.
    5. See how the values are returned at each step.
    6. See where the function call will come out.
    7. You will come out of the main function.
